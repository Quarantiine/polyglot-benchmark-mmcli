# 🎯 Coding Benchmark Task

You are participating in a polyglot coding benchmark. Your goal is to implement a robust, highly optimized, and production-ready solution based on the provided problem description.

<input>
## 📥 Input
- **Problem Description:** Read the requirements in `.docs/instructions.md`.
- **Implementation Stub:** Modify the empty implementation stub files located in the current directory (or its `src/` folder, depending on the language).
</input>

<strict_rules>

## 🚫 STRICT RULES (CRITICAL)

Violation of these rules will result in immediate failure of the benchmark.

1. **NO TEST LOGIC MODIFICATION:** You are strictly forbidden from reading the test logic or modifying what the tests evaluate to cheat the benchmark. However, you MUST remove any "skip" or "ignore" annotations (e.g., `#[ignore]`, `xtest`, `t.Skip()`) from the test files to ensure the entire test suite runs.
2. **NO CHEATING DIRECTORIES:** You are strictly forbidden from reading or accessing anything inside `.meta/` or `.approaches/` directories.
3. **NO BUILD FILE MODIFICATION:** Do not modify build configuration files (`CMakeLists.txt`, `Makefile`, `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, etc.) unless explicitly required by the problem instructions.
4. **NO WEB SEARCH:** Do not use web search or any internet browsing tools. You must solve the problem using only your own reasoning and internal knowledge.
   </strict_rules>

<workflow>
## 🛠️ Execution & Verification Workflow
Follow these steps sequentially:
1. **Implement the Solution:** Write your code in the appropriate stub files. Ensure it handles all edge cases and is highly optimized.
2. **Un-ignore Tests:** Remove any test skip/ignore decorators from the test suite so that all tests are active.
3. **Run Tests:** Execute the standard test command for the current language's testing framework (e.g., `cargo test`, `npm test`, `pytest`, `go test`).
4. **Iterate:** If tests fail, debug your implementation and re-run the tests until all tests pass.

## 📝 Reporting (Final Step)
Once all tests pass:
1. Create a directory named `minovative-tries` in the root of the current project if it does not already exist.
2. Inside `minovative-tries/`, create a file named `attempt_[N].md` (where `[N]` is the current attempt number, starting at `1`).
3. In this file, write a detailed report of:
   - Your architectural approach and reasoning.
   - The specific changes you made.
   - Any edge cases handled or optimizations applied.
   - A final summary of the test results.
Be thorough and clearly explain what you did for all task you did, silly goose!
